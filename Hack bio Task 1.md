## INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer is characterized by overexpression of specific receptors, estrogen and human epidermal growth factor receptors that promote tumor progression through a cascade of responses. The knowledge on these receptors has led to development of therapeutic drugs like tamoxifen. However, these drugs pose significant irreversible side effects thus leading to a gap in treatment. 

Natural products bridge this gap because of its unmatched chemical diversity with structural complexity and biological potency. This study seeks to identify a more selective compound (ligand) against breast cancer from _Citrus limetta._ 

## METHODOLOGY 

3D structures of proteins; BCL-2, BCL-W, MCL-1, ERɑ, and ligands from natural products; hecogenin acetate, hesperidin, podototarin, theaflavin were retrieved from online sources, and then converted for docking analysis. Molecular docking analysis of ligands was done using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2, protein-ligand complexes were visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer 20.1. Molecular dynamics simulation of hesperidin-ERɑ and hesperidin-MCL-1 complexes was done using GROMACS 2018, to prove stability and compactness of structure.

Hesperidin was extracted from albedo of _Citrus limetta_ and analyzed using analytical reverse-phase HPLC to assess its purity. Hesperidin-loaded nanoliposomes were prepared (Hasan _et al_., 2014) and physicochemical properties determined by dynamic scattering light, entrapped efficiency of hesperidin in nanoliposome was analyzed (Rama _et al_., 2013) and morphology of nanoliposome was examined using TEM. Cytotoxicity assay of hesperidin was assessed using MTT assay (Taghizadeh _et al_., 2021) and IC<sub>50</sub>, GI<sub>50</sub>, and LC<sub>50</sub> were calculated (Taghizadeh _et al_., 2020). 


## RESULTS

Molecular docking results showed hesperidin strong binding affinity to BCL-W, MCL-1, and ERα proteins, while theaflavin bound to BCL-2. The stability of the protein-ligand complexes is attributed to hydrogen bonds, pi interactions, and alkyl interactions. The hesperidin-MCL-1 complex is the most stable, with lower RMSD value, less fluctuation, higher compactness, lower Rg and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations indicating stronger protein-ligand interactions. Hesperidin cytotoxicity assay shows increased effectiveness when encapsulated in nanoliposomes further supporting its potential as an anticancer agent, particularly against breast cancer cells.

## CONCLUSION 

Natural products can be used for therapeutic and nutritional purposes of humans because they have no side effects and are of natural origin. Hesperidin's strong binding power to MCL-1 receptors and high stability make it a promising target for drug or food additive treatment as shown from the results of this study. In vitro studies demonstrated its ability to kill MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines without significantly affecting MCF10A normal cell lines. Therefore, natural products offer a promising alternative to synthetic and chemical drugs.
